<td><p>0x8004005 : E_FAIL</p></td>
<td><p>The most often occurrence of this error code is during the verification of the Recorded file for Video or Photo. This will occur if the resulting file contains no data because it did not receive samples.</p>
<p>Check to ensure the device is producing valid samples when it enters the run state. Valid includes that the sample is the right size, format, and time for when it was produced</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td><p>0x80070102</p></td>
<td><p>This will occur when a Capture Asynchronous Operation has timed out. These include Initialize, Start Preview, Stop Preview, Start Record, Stop Record, Take Photo, and Change Mediatype. The test allows for 9-10 seconds for each operation before failing. Mediatype change can include pin tear down and bring up time.</p>
<p>Check that the device isn’t waiting for future commands that prevent it from changing state. Ensure that all buffers are flushed out of the device on device reset commands.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>0xC00D3704 : MF_E_HW_MFT_FAILED_START_STREAMING</p></td>
<td><p>This error occurs when the device cannot enter the run state.</p>
<p>Check that the device is able to transition through all states without failure, or that other pins aren’t preventing the device from entering a state.</p>
<p>Multiple cameras might prevent each other from streaming due to bus allocation failure. Please ensure that each camera has enough bandwidth to stream. This can be impaired by other devices using the same bus, including other cameras.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>0xC00D4A44 : MF_E_SINK_NO_SAMPLES_PROCESSED</p></td>
<td><p>This error occurs during finalization of files, if no samples have been delivered.</p>
<p>Check to ensure the device is producing valid samples when it enters the run state. Valid includes that the sample is the right size, format, and time for when it was produced.</p></td>
